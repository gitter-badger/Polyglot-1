Create translations for your Umbraco pages with the click of a button, with untranslated content falling back to a default language even for individual parts of a page. A solution that implements what is often called a 1:1 multilingual site structure.

**Tip for developers:** You're going to have some missing references because I do not redistribute the Umbraco libraries the project is referring to. To solve that, create a folder called UmbracoBinaries inside the cloned solution folder and copy the dlls from an Umbraco instance there.
